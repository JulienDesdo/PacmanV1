# ** Pacman Microsoft Fundation Class ** 

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! This is my first project in C++. It is the project for class on MFC. 
They asked to design a pacman game (no graphics) with dialog box. 

## **Summary**

For the design I wanted to code the movement in discrete and then use interpolations, 
but unfortunately that was an unnecessarily complicated idea. 

I also intended to add some extra elements but I didn't have the courage to finish it afterwards ahahah. 
These elements included teleporters, special powers (strong pacman to break walls, added speed...).
